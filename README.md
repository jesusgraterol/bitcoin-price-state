# Bitcoin Price State

Understanding the price state of Bitcoin, stocks or any other asset is essential to open/increase/reduce/close positions as it can reveal the trend, as well as overbought and oversold states.

This notebook will go through an approach that provides a deep analysis of the price state for any asset within a time window. The state can then be used to generate events capable of triggering position actions at the "right" time.
